### Local farm service

Local farm service is a tyny plot of land, cultivated with eco-determined people, whose dream is to show the world how we all should treat ouer one and only Nature

### Description

Small-business farmers do hard work to produce healthy fresh fruit and vegetables. 

If farmera are eco-friendly, they are tightly limited in the way they work. They can not use harmfull chemistry< but still the pests are still there, waiting. Supermarkets buy the production and pay as less as they can, move products to the end of the world and sell unfreshy and expensive, cos they also have a lot of costs.

Our projects is made to popularize another way to make peace between produsers and customers. We say: "Buy local, get fresh". Local farms need help to set up small shops, where they could sell there production fast to preserve freshness and get as much money as customers are ready to pay. 

We also try to bring up concsious and responsible generation. We can teach pre-school and elder children to grow plants, to use harmless things in everyday life, to lead eco-friendly lifestyle. 

Adults are welcome as well. We can allocate a plot of lend at a low charge, so you can grow plants by your own. Only one restriction is - use only ecological way.
